The current arena mode have too short fights, games are in practice shorter
than the loading screen sometimes is, making something like a campaign a very
short ordeal.

What needs to be done is to extend individual arena fights by making them
longer. The most realistic way of doing this is by having multiple challanges
follow eachother with increasing difficulty.

#Design

The player enters the arena with a given challenge, such as 1v1 hand combat or
2v2 sword. After the fight is over and the player wins the next wave starts
with new enemies. It would be preferable to keep the player on the ground
between rounds and not respawn him/her as it would create a cut in the flow of
the game.

Additional fun to have features would be:

* Have new enemies enter the arena via gates, meaning the spawn outside the
  view of the player
* Have a visual indicator, either in world or on hud indicating how far the
  player has come in the challenges, this could additionally be indicated with
  the intensity of the arena music.
