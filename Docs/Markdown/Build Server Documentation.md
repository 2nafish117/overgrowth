Overgrowths buildsystem is a buildbot based setup, using a central linux debian machine for building, and three slaves running on debian, windows and macosx respectively.

Each slave has the software needed to compile the program for their respective operating system. All commands are programmed and sent from the master to the slaves, which execute the
commands in a local shell.
